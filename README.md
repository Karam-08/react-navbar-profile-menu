# Profile Navbar

This project is a responsive React navbar with mobile & desktop layouts and a profile dropdown. It includes simulated authentication using localStorage to persist login state across page refreshes. The navbar supports keyboard accessibility, smooth CSS transitions, and adaptive behavior on window resize. All authentication is frontend-only and intended for learning, demos, or portfolio use.
